# Resonant Amp

## Building and paths

The project is configured assuming the VST3 SDK is found at: `C:\SDKs\VST_SDK\VST3_SDK\`

## DSP

Most of the DSP is handled C++ code generated by faust. The code is in the
header file `Source/abamp.h` which is generated by running:

```
cd dsp/
pythhon buildamp.py
```
